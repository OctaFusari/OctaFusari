<h1>Octavian Fusari</h1>
<p>Hiiii I am octavian a nineteen year old boy who comes from Italy, and if you are looking for a frontend programmer, here I am!
I love designing applications, websites, and more. Beyond that, right now I'm learning 
backend programming on my own and I'm trying to improve my skills by making a lot of projects.
Right now I'm looking for a company around the world where I can work and learn what I don't know
and improve my skills in what I already know.
